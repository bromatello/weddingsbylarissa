                    Larissa was extremely helpful and always willing to go the extra mile in offering assistance as we planned our elopement to New York.<br />She always replied to emails in a timely manner and responded to concerns and questions in a caring manner. - <span class="names">Tess</span><br /><br />

                    From the first e-mail we received from Larissa we knew she had to marry us! Larissa is as professional as she is lively, bubbly and just so easy to work with.<br />She was extremely helpful leading up to the wedding as well making sure we had everything sorted before we flew out of Sydney to New York and the service she put together for us was just beautiful.
                    <br /><br />
                    We'd recommend Larissa to any bride or groom looking to get married in New York! - <span class="names">Michelle</span><br /><br />

                    Larissa is a well rounded person. She is cheerful, friendly and creative. Most importantly she has a great spirit and I felt confident in my decision to hire her as my wedding officiant. - <span class="names">Jessica</span><br /><br />

                    Larissa was recommended to us by another officiant who was booked on the day of our wedding. We couldn't have asked for a better officiant / celebrant.<br />Larissa spent a great deal of time getting to know us and worked with us to create a non-denominational ceremony that was perfectly tailored to us as a couple. She came up with ideas and readings that made the ceremony even more intimate and special than we could have imagined. It was a pleasure working with her and we would strongly recommend her to other couples. - <span class="names">Nida</span><br /><br />

                    We used Larissa to get married in New York and it was the best choice we could have made, as we eloped from the UK so were pretty much clueless with everything until we found her !!! She help with everything from flowers to make up to hair to location she could not have been more helpful, and that was all before we had even met her. <br /><br />
                    She then came to met us the day before in the hotel where we were staying and instantly we were put at easy and reconfirmed that we had made the right choice it was like meeting with a friend.
                    The day of the ceremony she tailored everything to suit us and really really made our day super special. <br />
                    I would recommend her to anyone she was totally fantastic and I can honestly say that without her the day would not have been the same. - <span class="names">Lilly</span><br /><br />

                    Location: Mandarin Oriental Hotel New York <br /><br />
                    Larissa Martell was a true and exceptional find.<br />Phil and I discussed our elopement to New York some 3 months ago and didn't actually do or make any arrangements until a month beforehand.<br />Larissa came on high recommendation. She confirmed her availability straight away and was extremely helpful with regards to the process.<br />Everything was confirmed again via email. Leading up to the date of our elopement Larissa asked for any special readings, family members that we wanted to remember and had asked questions of both Phil and I (separately) about one another. She managed to incorporate these just before our vows which made it personal, memorable and injected some humour too which made our photographers and witnesses to the ceremony laugh and smile.<br /> Larissa made our day special. Before I/we finally met Larissa the day before the wedding at the Mandarin..I felt we were meeting up with a friend. She is truly lovely, personable and a gorgeous person and now our new friend.
                    <br /><br />
                    If you are looking for an officiate, someone who can make your wedding special then pick Larissa....You wont regret it.

                    Finding Larissa for our wedding was the best thing that could have happened for us. We searched online for many nights and the one person who was recommended to us by a friend was booked.<br /> As we continued to search and search we came across many strange people and could not find someone who we actually enjoyed talking to. We thought that is was going to be a disaster coming from two different cultures and that it wouldn't be possible to create something that was unique and personalized for us but then we found Larissa online and set up a date to meet.<br /> As soon as she started talking to us we knew she was the one and booked her right away. She is extremely down to earth and caring and it was a great pleasure working with her each step of the way. She personalized our story and even managed to include our son and nephew into the ceremony (improvised), which was something I didn't even think of because they are both 4 years old and can sometimes be tough cookies to work with. She really took her time and created something that was amazing and everything that we wanted and more. <br />I highly recommend Larissa to anyone who wants someone who truly cares for the people she works with and who can personalize the ceremony to absolutely anything that you want it to be.<br /><br />THANK YOU LARISSA!

                    We travelled from Australia to get married in New York (at the Empire Fulton-Ferry Boardwalk under the Brooklyn Bridge), and of course not being in the city whilst planning our wedding was tricky for some aspects, this was not one of them. Larissa was so obliging, professional and honestly an absolute pleasure to work with.<br />Right from the beginning, we felt very comfortable with her and she understood exactly what we wanted.<br />Our day, whilst it flew by, was perfect and we have Larissa to thank for a big part of that! - <span class="names">Josh and Amanda</span><br /><br />

                    We would like to thank Larissa for the beautiful job she did with our wedding! It was fantastic to have her as our officiant!
                    <br /><br />
                    Preparations for our wedding took a bit of a dramatic turn when due to circumstances beyond anyone's control our work with our originally selected officiant had to be canceled.
                    <br />
                    So Larissa came to our rescue, and despite the short time she had to bring everything together, we could not be happier with the outcome!
                    <br />
                    We learned of Larissa through our wedding planner, Nina Hoffer, and we are so grateful for the recommendation! Larissa made us feel completely comfortable after just one meeting. She then followed up proactively with phone conversations and numerous emails back and forth, so we felt that we have her undivided attention and support. With less then a week before the wedding, Larissa managed to work with us on a script of the ceremony, modify some details and give us some valuable suggestions which made the ceremony even more personal and special. Larissa even gave us a book on wedding readings for inspiration, which actually contained a better version of a piece we originally selected!
                    <br />
                    We thought our wedding ceremony went very smoothly and beautifully, our guests are still remarking on what a lovely ceremony it was!
                    <br /><br />
                    Larissa is a great speaker, wonderful professional and a very warm and fun person in general! We would highly recommend her!

                    Finding Larissa to officiate our wedding was a dream come true!<br /><br />Prior to being introduced to Larissa, I had spoken with a few officiants who couldn't have been farther from what we were looking for. Larissa is extremely down to earth, personable, and overall a wonderful person.<br />She is genuine and really listened to what we were looking for and in the end, delivered exactly that in our ceremony.<br />Throughout the entire process, Larissa was extremely accommodating (came to our apartment twice and braved our 7 pound "killer" of a dog) and really put us at ease. Overall, Larissa was absolutely amazing to work!<br /><br />I would recommend Larissa to anyone who is looking for an officiant who truly cares about what she does and the couples she marries. - <span class="names">Amanda</span>
